## Proposal 3 - Predciting ideal schedule for Uber/Lyft drivers 

**1. High level description of project.**
I will be using transportation datasets from Chicago to predict the ideal times of day/days of week and sections of the city a freelance Uber/Lyft driver should work to maximise his/her earnings. 

**2. What question or problem are you trying to solve?**
Freelance Uber/Lyft drivers are presented with the 

**3. How will you present your work?**

Ideally: A visualization in the form of a map of the city where the driver can input his/her desired shift length or the desired times of the day they would like to work. , The map will then let them know the ideal locations to work, based on the time of day or the ideal time slots to work, based on location. 

Backup plan: Powerpoint slides. 

**4. What are your data sources?**
Transportation datasets from the City of Chicago Data Portal. Datasets I will be *definitely* looking at include: Taxi Trips, Average Daily Traffic Counts and  Historical Congestion Estimates. Datasets I *hope* to add in include historical weather data and historical event data to add additional predictive ability to my project. 

**5. What’s your next step towards making this your project.**
I will be looking into learning about map visualzations and GIS data wrangling packages.

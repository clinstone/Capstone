## Final Proposal

**1. What are you trying to do?  Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon (i.e. as if
you were explaining to a salesperson, executive, or recruiter).**

In hospitals, the intensive care unit (ICU) admits severely ill patients in order to provide life saving treatment. One of the most important outcomes measured in ICUs are mortality rates (death rates). Doctors use [scoring systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Scoring_Systems) in order to predict a patient's mortality risk during their ICU stay. 

There have been several different scoring systems developed and in use including: 
  * [The Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23660729)
  * [Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAPS_II)
  * [Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOFA_score) 

My capstone will evalute each of these 3 different scoring systems ability to predict patient mortality. I will be also be attempting to combine the 3 scoring systems into one 'super scorer' and test it's predicitve ability. 


**2. How has this problem been solved before? If you feel like you are addressing a novel
issue, what similar problems have been solved, and how are you borrowing from those?**

Past studies have tested the predictive power of individual scoring systems. The studies also used the whole adult population as one, irregardless of clinical diagnoses. Also, in my clinical experience, hospitals tend to use/favor one scoring system based on doctor preference, tradition or the hospital sub-culture. Rarely, if ever do, hospitals use all three. Also clinicans/heathcare professionals tend to use the same scoring system for the entire adult patient population in the ICU (children and newborns tend to have different scoring systems). 

**3. What is new about your approach, why do you think it will be successful?**

I plan on combining all three scoring systems and using all their individual variables/features to predict mortality. I will also be using various machine learning algorithims such as: 
  * Logistic Regression (LR),
  * Logistic regression with an L1 regularization penalty using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator
(LASSO), 
  * Logistic regression with an L2 regularization penalty (L2), and
  * Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GB).
 
 I will be dividing the patient population by their admitting diagnoses, to check if certain scoring systems work better with certain disorder/admitting diagnosis sub-types (e.g. neurological v/s respiratory v/s cardiac). 
 
 I also be attempting to perform dimensionality reduction on the combined variables/features. I will be doing this as some of the scoring systems were designed in the 1980's based on collaborative expert input, while others were designed in the 1990's and 2000's using multiple logistic regression. I want to combine these two methodologies and then perform dimensionality reduction to see I can get the 'best of both worlds', so to speak. 


**4. Who cares?  If you're successful, what will the impact be?**

Healthcare professionals in ICUs across the country and the world will be able to use my 'super scorer' to monitor their patients and predict mortality rates. Thus patient's identified as high-risk can receive immediate intervention. If my 'real-time' prediction visualizations are scaled up, hospitals can use that as a live dashboard to monitor their patients, thus clinicans can be notified immediately when their patients condition worsens. Hospitals that use only one scoring system can now benefit from using all 3 combined. Electronic health record (EHR) vendors can use my 'super scorer' to encourage hospitals to switch from paper charting and purchasing their proprietary system. 

*Human lives could potentially be saved.*  


**5. How will you present your work?** 
  
The main way I will present my work is through a Powerpoint presentation, with slides explaining my results. However, time permitting, I would like to create a visualization of 'real-time' predictions of a subsection of patients. This will be a proof-of-concept that hospitals could then scale up to include all their patients. 

**6. What are your data sources? What is the size of your dataset, and what is your storage format?**

The [MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) Clinical Database](https://mimic.physionet.org/) developed by the MIT Lab for Computational Physiology. It is a large collection of de-identified electronic medical records for over 40,00 patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA, USA between 2001 and 2012. The database consists of 26 comma-separated-value (CSV) files. The total size of the uncompressed files is 47GB. All tables combined there are 534 columns and 728,556,685 rows. I had to complete an online course and submit an official application requesting access to the database. 


**7. What are potential problems with your capstone, and what have you done to mitigate these problems?**

This is not a problem as such, but the [Gordian Knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordian_Knot) I am faced with is to extract the 10 - 15 variables each that the 3 scoring systems are based on (lab values, vital signs, [comorbid diagnoses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity), etc.) from the 534 columns and 728,556,685 rows. In order to mitigate this issue I have researched and found the [SchemaSpy](http://schemaspy.org/) of the database and printed out the connections between the 26 tables and identified the columns in each that I need to extract. This will make the job of writing the SQL queries much easier. 


**8. What is the next thing you need to work on?**
  
  * I already have downloaded all my data. The next step is for me to finalize which of the following methods I shall be using going forward: 
    * Spin up an AWS EC2 and use Postgres (the method suggested by MIT, the providers of the database). 
    * Spin up an AWS EMR and use Spark. 
    * Use Amazon Redshift. 
    * Use Dask (not very familiar with this, but links like [this](http://docs.dask.org/en/latest/spark.html) and [this](https://matthewrocklin.com/blog//work/2018/08/28/dataframe-performance-high-level) are promising. 
  
  * I am going to be conducting research into the feasibity and cost effectiveness of each method. 
  * I am going to write and run the SQL queries needed to extract the variables/features I need to run my models.
